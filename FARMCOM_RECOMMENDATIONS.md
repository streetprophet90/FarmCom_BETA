3. **Dashboard Enhancements**: Completed earlier than planned, providing foundation for other features
4. **Enhanced Notification System**: Evolved from basic notifications to comprehensive system with user preferences and real-time features

### Technical Evolution
- **Original Approach**: Simple role-based permissions
